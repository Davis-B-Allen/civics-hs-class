## Motivation

Hackettstown High School has discontinued their civics class because not enough students were interested in taking it. This is sad. Civics is important (see: the shit happening in America right now (and, China for that matter)). But it should also be fun. Democratic, creative collaboration toward a common, exciting goal should be fun.

## Objectives (in increasing order of ambition)

- (Meta) Have fun
- (Meta) Creatively collaborate
- (Meta) Learn something
- (Meta) Make something we're proud of
- Employ the UbD template to conceptualize the course [UbD template](https://www.d.umn.edu/~hrallis/courses/3204sp05/assignments/ubd_template.htm)
- Design a high school class (i.e. the set of materials necessary for a teacher to teach a class) on civics, subject to the design goals and constraints below
- Run the class at Hackettstown High school
- Share the class freely and openly for any teacher to make use of
- Share the class in such a way that it is easy for other teachers to contribute their own ideas back to improve the class
- Maintain the shared class, incorporating insightful feedback from other teachers as they provide it

## Design Goals and Constraints

For the students:
- Fun, democratic, creative collaboration toward a common, exciting goal (learning about civics)

For the teachers:
- Must be easy enough to manage the students who are participating in a: *Fun, democratic, creative collaboration toward a common, exciting goal (learning about civics)*







## Initial Concept (old)

- Concept for a High School Civics Elective Class
- "Democracy should not just be something you read about, it should be something you *do*."
- Overall class syllabus gives brief review of the different units, how much each unit is worth in terms of final course grade, and briefly discusses the philosophy of the class (learn by doing, this is a class on civics and participatory democracy, so we're gonna DO some of that, but hopefully in a fun, playful, game-like way).

The course comprises a number of units, a few of them based off [nomic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomic).

For the nomic-based units, the "syllabus" (e.g. the nomic document with the rules) is basically just a nomic, with several parts (Mission, Constitution, Rules). It should be designed such that the teacher can just hand each student a copy, stick the index cards for each rule on the board, and then just sit in silence, waiting for the students to start figuring out what to do or asking questions (the teacher should help where necessary, but this is primarily student-driven). Each "syllabus" for each of the different units will of course, differ, but they will have some things in common:

- Mission
	- Our goal is to learn about [subject of unit] (i.e. brief summary of subject of unit, and simplest possible learning objective: learn more about this subject)
	- Our goal is to work together (explain philosophy of course; participatory, game-like nature, etc.)
	- students will need to organize themselves and collaborate toward common goal (learning, and a good grade for the unit)
	- the only thing they're given is this nomic document (including its rules for self-amendment), educational resources, and the teacher at their disposal
- Constitution (i.e. the actually, really, truly immutable rules):
	- Teacher must ratify or veto all changes the students make to the Rules (i.e. the mutable rules; see below) (Teacher is the "executive"(/and "judiciary"); students are "citizenry"/"voters"/"legislators," depending on unit)
	- The entire class gets the same baseline grade (A+/A/A-/B+/B/B-/C+/C/C-/D+/D/D-/F) for the nomic-based unit
		- Optional: But teacher might adjust individuals' grades up two levels or down two levels, depending on participation/effort
			- e.g. if baseline is B-, then students who didn't try might get C+ or C, while students who made the effort might get B or B+
			- better not to include this variance though, if it can be avoided
		- idea is that the entire class is all in this together. The incentive of the grade (and the fact that the entire class gets the same grade) is what binds them together as a "community," and motivates them to work toward common purpose (besides the fact that this class will hopefully be inherently collaborative and fun!)
	- Might include some civil behavior rules in the constitution (be nice, be inclusive, don't turn this into "Lord of the Flies," etc.)
	- Students may use: [Link to relevant learning resources for this unit] as a starting point for their educational exploratio, if they wish
	- Teacher is available as a resource to students
- Rules (i.e. the mutable rules) (dependent on unit):
	- CLASS ASSIGNMENT for the unit:
		- the *entire class* must make a *collective* presentation on the topic of the unit
			- But it might have several components, students could perhaps self-organize into "committees" for these
				- thus yielding more work in smaller groups, and several final presentations that each tackle a different aspect of the overall subject for the unit
		- can also define further subsidiary learning objectives, if we want
		- maybe provide a set of relatively open-ended questions (specific to this unit) that the students can choose to consider/address in their presentation, if they want
	- Students can amend the rules, and the initial rules define how this is done, depending on unit
	- Teacher facilitates the students' democratic process of rule amendment, and the initial rules define how this is done, depending on unit
	- Note that the CLASS ASSIGNMENT for the unit is part of the rules, and the students can vote to change it (though the teacher can veto, if they're being dickheads)
	- If necessary, some of the final rules can suggest that the students have the power to create offices / committees to organize themselves toward their goal
	- Goal is for students to start organizing themselves, to teach themselves about the subject of the unit, and deliver on the CLASS ASSIGNMENT

### Unit 1: Democracy, and Direct Democracy (nomic-based)

- Subject of unit: Democracy, and Direct Democracy
- rules allow students to raise their hands, teacher calls on students at his/her discretion, students suggest rule changes, then ALL students vote yea/nay with equal weight... (i.e. rules are structured so we start with a flat, direct democracy)
- We could also have some initial material on "what is democracy?", "what is civics?", etc. or we could just allow students to form their own impressions on this through the process of playing this democratic game and learning.

### Unit 2: Voting systems (for electing a single person to a single office)

- Start by letting the students know that they're going to vote on the one student who best exemplified democratic spirit and service to community during Unit 1. Imagine it like a presidential election (although, since the teacher is the executive, perhaps more like a vice-presidential "election.")
- Hold the vote with fptp/winner-take-all
- Now, there are actually many different ways to vote for people. We just voted by the system we're familiar with, but now we're going to learn about it in more detail, as well as some other ways in which we can vote:
	- fptp/winner-take-all
	- RCV
	- Condorcet methods
- This is now like more conventional teaching (I would imagine). Some esoteric information must be conveyed to students, and they must just learn it. This unit will have some more typical lectures and readings
- Can have more typical assessments in this section (quizzes, homeworks, or whatever)
- Hold one or two further votes (by RCV / some Condorcet method), see if they yield different results than FPTP; thus, up to three different students get a gold star sticker or whatever (whatever you're supposed to do to symbolically reward students). Maybe have "inauguration" parties for them, or let them make a "presidential acceptance speech" or some sort of certificate materials included in the course kit, or whatever.
- Maybe the student(s) who win(s) can work with the teacher for one out-of-class period to make suggestions about future units

### Unit 3: Representative Democracy (nomic-based)

- Subject of unit: Representative Democracy
- rules require students to start by voting for several class "representatives." Students should now have a sense (after Unit 1) of which classmates of theirs are likely to make the best representatives, so no need for a "campaign."
	- Teacher divides up the students RANDOMLY and evenly into several groups of equal size, and then each group votes amongst themselves for one of them to represent the group, yielding several different representatives
		- basically: single-member districts with first-past-the-post
- the representatives are the only ones who can make changes to the rules. They consult with their "constituents" (the other students from their group) and the teacher. The rules define this system, but can of course be changed by the representatives (who could even revert it back to direct democracy if they really wanted to, but this shouldn't necessarily be encouraged)
- The CLASS ASSIGNMENT for this unit is the same (from the template at top: class presentation). The initial groups and their representatives perhaps lend natural initial structure for students to form different "committees" to tackle different parts of the assignment, but, once again, this is all up to them through these nomic rules
- initial rules can define several more recurring "representative" elections throughout the duration of the unit (but, these rules can, of course, be changed by the students)

### Unit 4: Voting systems (for multi-member bodies, like a legislature)

- Run a final "representative" election by the rules of Unit 3, and note the winners
- Now, we're going to learn about the different ways in which we can elect a group of representatives from a larger population:
	- What we just did: FPTP in single member districts (including political parties, two-party systems, tactical voting and duverger's law)
	- RCV in single member districts
	- STV
	- Proportional representation
	- MMP
- This, like with Unit 2, is more conventional teaching/lecturing/readings, with more conventional assessments (quizzes, homeworks etc.)

### Unit 5: Gerrymandering (not nomic-based, but hopefully fun and active)

- Finally, at the end of the unit: we're going to look at one particular problem of FPTP in single member districts: gerrymandering
- Divide the students into two even "teams" (i.e. parties), and tell them to remember their parties. Give each party a trivial ideology (e.g. one party is the Coke party and the other is the Pepsi party, or something. Choose something non-controversial). Now you're going to divide the students up into several "districts." Gerrymander the districts so that one team will win outright. (In the course materials for teachers, we can provide sheets for how to do this with any number of students)
	- Ask the students to get into their districts and 'vote' - they should vote for their team (e.g. if they're on team Coke, they vote coke; if they're on team pepsi, they vote pepsi) and give a brief, funny, one-or-two sentence explanation (as to why they're a die-hard Coke person, or why they're a die-hard pepsi person) as they do so.
		- Now, re-district all the students, gerrymandering them the other way (so that the other team will win)
			- vote again.
				- Make sure students note that the number of Coke voters vs pepsi voters didn't change, but the outcome did, based on the way the teacher grouped the students. If the teacher gets to decide the districts, they can decide the election
					- don't mention american politics

### Unit 6: American system of government

- Typical civics class fodder. Constitution. Amendments. Laws. 3 Branches of govt (executive, legislative, judicial). checks and balances. etc. etc. etc. However, we can make frequent references back to everything the students have learned thus far, and we can point out the ways in which the American system differs from many (and, in some respects, most) other governments around the world
- This is not a class on American Government. It is not an American History class. It is a class on civics and participatory democracy.
- references to stuff the students have learned:
	- US has representative democracy, not direct. Executive vs Legislature in terms of electing 1-person vs multi-member body. etc.
- contrasts with other countries:
	- We're one of the few that does FPTP w/ SMD. We have separate, quite powerful executive (in contrast with parliamentary systems. students may notice that they're sort of like the legislature, and the teacher is sort of like the executive+judicial/supreme court in one, and is much more powerful than the students). etc.

### Unit 7: Liquid Democracy and more modern democratic innovations (open-source governance?) (nomic-based)

- Subject of unit: Liquid Democracy (AKA Delegative democracy)
- rules for this nomic unit implement liquid democracy with some technology. Voting can happen in class, but there is also "homework" in a sense, in that the students can keep playing the nomic outside of class (need some app or web platform that implements the delegative democracy)
- Every student has a vote, and all votes are equal. BUT: every student can also choose another student who will act as their proxy in the event that they don't care to vote on a given measure. Students can change their delegate at any time. If a student DOES vote, it doesn't matter who their delegate is - they are using their vote themselves. But if they don't vote, then their delegate can vote with their additional vote.
- In this unit, the nomic game is played in digital form, with some web app that would need to be developed). During class, it seems likely that all students would participate in the voting. But students can carry on the game outside of class, though it is not compulsory
- In this unit students are trying to produce a presentation on delegative democracy and other interesting innovations in democracy

### Unit 8: Review + Context, Scale, Social Contract

- For all the nomic-based, participatory, civics-education-as-civics-practice stuff the students have done throughout this course, it's time to place it in context and talk big-picture about what this means for them as they become adults: as members of communities, as citizens of their country, etc. Make the distinction between opt-in communities and inescapable communities (i.e. societies that you're born into and can't easily get out of independently - like the USA, if you're a US citizen). Discuss social contract.
- How do democratic systems scale as the community they govern grows larger? (e.g. Direct vs. Representative vs. Delegative democracy, and what value these have when we're talking about hundreds/thousands/millions/hundreds of millions of people, rather than 30 students in a classroom).
- Can discuss technology and the future, review some of the interesting stuff the kids have hopefully found in Unit 7 (stuff that the teacher may not have even been aware of). This could be a more open discussion with the class, otherwise the teacher would presumably have to assemble insights on short notice, based on the class' work.

### Unit 9: Self-directed (nomic-based)

Subject of unit: open-ended
- In this unit, we start with rules that are pretty much the basic direct-democracy unit rules (i.e. rule changing is limited, by default, to the classroom). We might suggest that the students can move to the online platform and use the liquid democracy rules if they want, but they'd need to change the rules to this by a majority vote in the classroom (under the initial direct-democracy rules.)
- However, unlike the other nomic-based units, the ASSIGNMENT for this unit is different (it's not a class presentation). The assessment for this unit DOES still require the entire class to work together and they all receive the same grade, BUT:
- aside from that, the assignment is entirely open-ended: the students may use the nomic structure to define their final project to be anything they want, as long as they manage to agree on it democratically. There should be one very general initial rule along the lines of "the class must try to make something that they are proud of and that the teacher will find appropriate to the topic of the course"
- the only assessment / grading rule will be that the teacher will grade them collectively, as a class, on this basis (whether he/she thinks the class has made something they're proud of, and which is appropriate to the topic of the course)
- Finally,

### Unit 10: Meta (nomic-based)

- The class now must provide feedback on how to make this civics course better.
- The meta-objective here is to improve on the course materials so that future classes can have an even better experience with the course
- For each of the nomic-based units, the class should take the initial nomic document for the unit and start amending it by using its ruleset (as they have learned to do in each of the nomic units) based on their own impressions of the course, and how they would like it to be different if they were a new student taking it for the first time. The product that the class needs to produce is amended versions of each of the syllabuses (nomic documents) that incorporate their own views on what worked, what didn't, how the course could be improved, etc.
